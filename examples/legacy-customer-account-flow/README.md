# Hydrogen example: Legacy Customer Account Flow

üö® Caution: This legacy authentication strategy will not maintain authentication between your Hydrogen storefront and checkout; for support, use either the New Customer Accounts strategy or Multipass

This example contains the legacy customer account flow made with [Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront) which is meant to be reference only.

Passwordless login with [Customer Account API](<(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/customer)>) with the first version published in Jan 2024 is Shopify's recommended way to build headless customer experience.

If you are looking to use Shopify's customer login experience on a seperate webiste that is not a Shopify store. Check out the [multipass example](../multipass/).
